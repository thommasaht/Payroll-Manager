## About
Payroll Manager is a payroll automation system designed for use in restaurants or other businesses to calculate payroll. 

The software takes an employee's timecard data read as a .txt file and adds that employee to the directory for that payroll period. Employers have the option to implement tip pooling, decide how much goes to the house, and view employee payroll information for that period.
Payroll information includes total payout, payout by day, total hourly pay, hourly pay by day, total tips, and tips by day. Employers may also decide which jobs will be included in the tip pool and amount to disburse.
